# AERSP424_HW1

Welcome to our repository for homework 1!

For the grader of this assignment:

The file labeled FINAL Q1 will run our code for question 1
The file labeled FINAL Q2-5 will run our code for questions 2-5
The file labeled FINAL Q6-7 will run our code for questions 6-7
The file labeled FINAL Q8 will run our code for question 8

The majority of the code is the same across all of these files.  For the most part, the only thing that changes is our main function where we call different parts of the code to output our results for each section.

The file labeled TOTAL 1-7 will run ALL of our code for parts 1-7.  There are no lines commented out and it will output everything.
